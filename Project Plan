## Overview
We are building an e-commerce on blockchain using a smart contract in solidity. Our goal would be to use the 1155 ERC standards to buy and sell both fungible and non-fungible items. The buyers and sellers will be able to use our service on interfaces designed using UI/UX. We are going to be an open source market but our sellers will be protected from their intellectual property being stolen. 


## Question to Answer

# What is a Blockchain marketplace?
It is an online shopping marketplace that is run from a blockchain rather than a single central authority. Data is held on a set of decentralized computers or nodes and is stored in blocks that are linked in sequence to form a chain.
Advantages/value of using a blockchain marketplace

Blockchain marketplace is a peer to peer (P2P) network
Our sellers can directly transact with buyers without an involvement of any intermediaries

Blockchain marketplace is more valuable for certain type of products 
Our marketplace will allow trades be conducted globally. As no products will need to be physically moved, our marketplace will be best for heavy materials such as commodities such as gold, silver, and rare gems.

Blochchain marketplace payment process: 
Our payment process will be using cryptocurrencies. This allows transactions without a third-party payment provider, ultimately saving our users fees set by a third-party payment provider.



# Smart contracts intended: 
Fungible item contract 
Non-fungible item contract (tokenize the item)
Marketplace contract (selling, loss event, refund)
Logistic contract (for shipping)

# What does Intellectual Properties include?
Patents.
Trademarks.
Trade Secrets.
Copyright

# Task: 
1.Tokenzing contract
2.Auction contract
3.Marketplace contract



# Assigned Tasks

# Contracts
Tokenization Contract - Umme, M H, Andrew
Events: Patent, Year, Industry, appraisal value,
Market Contract - Rawlric, Priya
Auction Contract - Rawlric, Priya
Overall business - Fazle


## Plan

The tokenization contract will tokenize all the items in our marketplace - each token will have a unique token id regardless of patent/trademark etc.
	
Variable number 1 - Unique_id1 - Nile trademark image







Variable number 2 - shares float (number of shares is variable) - Use Pinata to get token_uri. 

Make function that creates tokens for unique ids

One contract for Auction/Marketplace - MartianAuction (22-3-1)



## Business Model - Profitability
We undercut our competition by collecting a smaller fee per transaction in our marketplace (Amazon collects on average 15%, we only collect 5-10%)
Our marketplace efficiently connects market buyers with market sellers
Blockchain technology best protects the sensitive content of Intellectual Property
Presents easy traceability  - trail of transactions, and provide irrefutable proof of ownership
